# reproducible-data-analysis
A repository holding materials for a half day reproducibility course.

The first part of the course revolves around the concept of [code smells](https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells).
In it, we ask the course participants to examine the following R code snippets:

- [SIR model](https://github.com/ben18785/reproducible-data-analysis/blob/main/src/example_1.md). A refactored version is [here]((https://github.com/ben18785/reproducible-data-analysis/blob/main/src/example_1_answer.md)).
- [vaccine function](https://github.com/ben18785/reproducible-data-analysis/blob/main/src/example_2.md). A refactored version is [here](https://github.com/ben18785/reproducible-data-analysis/blob/main/src/example_2.md).

The aim of this exercise is to critically evaluate this code and come up with a better way to write it.
